# Describe Someone
A dumb game for describing someone that I made in 40 minutes

## Run Locally
If you are here to play this (for whatever reason), do this:
(It only works on pc, I am very sorry mobile and mac users)

1. Download this repository (click Code, then Download ZIP)
2. Unzip it (go to where it downloaded, right click on the zip, then click 'Extract All' or 'Extract')
3. Inside the unzipped copy, open index.html in your browser (once you've unzipped it, open the folder version, then open index.html)
4. You can describe people now :D
